# Architecture

OCC Secure Exports is a [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) desktop app. It has two
parts separated by a hard trust boundary:

- a **WebView frontend** (React + TypeScript + Mantine) that renders the UI, and
- a **Rust core** that does all networking (S3) and all cryptography (`age`).

Everything sensitive — the private key, the S3 secret, the decryption — lives in
the Rust core. The frontend is treated as the _less_ trusted half and is
deliberately fenced off from the network.

## Trust boundary

The WebView can only talk to the core through the **Tauri command surface**
(`src-tauri/src/commands.rs`), exposed to the frontend as typed wrappers in
[`src/api.ts`](../src/api.ts). It has **no other capabilities**:

- A strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'`, set in
  [`tauri.conf.json`](../src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)) means the WebView cannot
  open any network connection. Even a hostile script injected into the frontend
  (e.g. via a compromised npm dependency) **cannot exfiltrate** the key, because
  the only way out of the WebView is an `invoke()` to the core, and the core
  never forwards key material anywhere except the configured S3 endpoint and the
  OS secure store.
- All S3 traffic and all `age` operations run in Rust. The private key, once
  parsed, is held as `age::Identity` values inside the in-memory `Session` and is
  **never serialized back to the frontend**.
- The only outbound connections are the configured **S3 endpoint** and a
  **version check** against the GitHub releases API (`check_update`) — both in
  the core. The update check fails soft (offline → "no update") and sends
  nothing but the request.

### Rust core (`src-tauri/src/`)

| File          | Responsibility                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `commands.rs` | The command surface; holds the in-memory `Session` (client, bucket, parsed identities)                       |
| `crypto.rs`   | `age` keygen, identity parsing (native age + OpenSSH), **header probe** (`matches_key`), streaming decrypt   |
| `s3.rs`       | Client construction (path-style, bounded timeouts, retries), paginated listing, **range fetch**              |
| `download.rs` | `GetObject` stream → `age` decrypt (or pass-through) → temp file → `fsync` → atomic rename; `safe_dest_path` |
| `profile.rs`  | Connection metadata (plain JSON) + secrets (OS secure store, one bundled entry per profile)                  |
| `error.rs`    | Serializable, user-friendly error type                                                                       |

## Key data flows

### Connect

`connect(profile, creds)` resolves the S3 secret and age key — from the form, or
from the OS secure store in a **single keychain read** — parses the key into
identities, builds the S3 client, validates with a 1-object probe, and stores the
`Session`. Connection metadata is plain JSON in the app config dir; secrets are
**only** in the secure store, and only if the user opted in.

### Key pre-check (on selection)

For the selected `.age` files, `check_keys` issues a **64 KiB HTTP range request**
per object (`Range: bytes=0-65535`) and runs `crypto::matches_key`, which tries to
decrypt only the `age` header. This reveals whether the connected key fits —
_without downloading the files_. Results are cached per object key with a TTL on
the frontend, so fast navigation doesn't re-probe.

### Download & decrypt

```
S3 GetObject (async ByteStream)
   → SyncIoBridge (async→sync, on a spawn_blocking worker)
   → age streaming decrypt  (.age)   |   byte copy (non-.age, pass-through)
   → BufWriter to a temp file next to the destination
   → fsync → atomic rename to the final name
```

Each file streams in 64 KiB chunks, so a multi-GB artifact never sits fully in
memory. The destination path comes from a frontend-built plan (folder structure
preserved) and is **re-sanitized** by `safe_dest_path` against path traversal.
On **any** error — wrong key, corrupt object, integrity failure, I/O error — the
temp file is removed, so no partial or plaintext output is ever left behind
(**fail-closed**).

## Threat model

| Key/secret persisted in plaintext                              | Secrets live only in the OS secure store; metadata JSON never contains them. The only plaintext key file is the Rescue Kit the user _optionally_ saves |

| Unattended decrypted key sitting in memory                     | Idle auto-disconnect drops the session                                                                                                                 |
| Untrusted/`http://` endpoints                                  | HTTPS by default; plain-HTTP triggers a loud warning                                                                                                   |

## Why pure-Rust crypto/TLS

S3 and TLS use `rustls` (no system OpenSSL), and `age` is a pure-Rust
implementation — so builds are reproducible across platforms and don't depend on
a system crypto library. The AWS SDK's `aws-lc-rs` backend compiles native
assembly, which is why **CMake + NASM** are build prerequisites.
